In this React application, the goal is to click the character portraits to earn points.  However, if the user clicks the same character more than one, the game is over!

- The images are shuffled every time the user clicks on a character.
- For each character that you click, the user will gain one point.
- If the user clicks on the same character more than once, the game will be over!
